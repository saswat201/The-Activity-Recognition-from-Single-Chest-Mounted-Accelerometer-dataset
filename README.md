The Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer dataset
The Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer dataset mainly comprises of uncalibrated accelerometer data mounted on 15 respondents(users). The experiment basically analyses 7 activities performed by each respondent. The dataset can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer. The activities in the dataset are codified by numbers and following are the information of the numbers assigned to each of the activity:

Working at computer is codified as 1
Standing up, Walking and going updown stairs is codified as 2
Standing is codified as 3
Walking is codified as 4
Going upDown stairs is codified as 5
Walking and talking with someone is codified as 6
Talking While Standing is codified as 7

Steps we performed
1.Data Preparation
2.Data Exploration
3.Data Visualization
4.Predictive Model building
5.performance evaluation
6.Conclusion and which model performed the best and why.
7.Feature Works-to create a web api and to build a ml based web application so as the user can easily access from application link.
